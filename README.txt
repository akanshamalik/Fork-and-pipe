Three files are given: small.txt, large.txt and medium.txt
All three of them contains string		

Wehave to write a program, such that:
1. open a file
2. Read each line of string - each line has exact 5 characters( 3 digit plus return and new line)
3. Convert the sTring to an integer
4. Calculate the sum of a ll integers in a data file
You have to do it by creating child and paren process and by connecting them through fork() and pipe().
The program should also ask the user how many process the user like to create to child and parent process.
